Description: Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R tables packages
    such as huxtable or GT. This package fills a gap where certain packages could
    be written out as RTF, but couldn't add certain metadata or features to the
    document that are required/expected in a report for a regulatory submission.
