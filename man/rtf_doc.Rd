\title{Create a \code{rtf_doc} object}
\usage{
rtf_doc(table, titles = list(), footnotes = list(), header.rows = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{A table of a supported class.}

\item{titles}{A list of \code{hf_line} objects.}

\item{footnotes}{An object/list of \code{hf_line}.}

\item{header.rows}{An integer determining how many rows of the table are
headers. Only used for huxtable tables.}
}
\value{
A list with a table, titles, and footnotes component. Class of "rtf_doc"
  with the properties describled below.
}
\description{
This constructs the main object that will be used to write the RTF document.
The object is composed of a table, titles(s), and footnote(s).

A table should be a supported class. The huxtable package is the most supported,
however there are methods for the GT package. The \code{rtf_doc} will inherit
the properties from the table passed.

The titles and footnotes are composed of \code{hf_line} objects.
}
\section{\code{rtf_doc} Properties}{

Document level properties will be used where they are not overriden by
\code{hf_line} or table properties.
\itemize{
\item{font - A string representing the font to display when it is not
  specified by the table or \code{hf_line}. Defaults to NA.}
\item{font_size - A numeric value representing the size of the font in points.
  Supports half points. Defaults to 12.}
\item{margins - Inches of margins in the document. Defaults to 1 for all
  margins(top, bottom, left, right).}
\item{orientation - Orientation of the document. The actual height and width
  of the document is determined by the pagesize attribute, this is just a
  flag for an RTF reader. Defaults to 'landscape'.}
\item{header_height - Height of the header where the titles and header rows
  are displayed. Defaults to .5.}
\item{footer_height - Height of the footer where the footnotes are displayed.
  Defaults to .5.}
\item{pagesize - Size of the page in inches. Defaults to 8.5(height) by
  11(width).}
\item{header.rows - Huxtable table only. Number of rows that are defined as
  the header that will be repeated across pages. Defaults to 1}
\item{ignore_cell_padding - Huxtable table only. Flag to ignore padding that
  is added during RTF encoding.}
