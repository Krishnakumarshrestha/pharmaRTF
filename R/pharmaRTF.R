#' @description
#' Enhanced RTF wrapper written in R for use with existing R tables packages
#' such as huxtable or GT. This package fills a gap where certain packages could
#' be written out as RTF, but couldn't add certain metadata or features to the
#' document that are required/expected in a report for a regulatory submission
#'
#' This package intends to provide a flexible and reliable framework to connect
#' R to a pharmaceutical reporting workflow.
